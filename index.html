            <h2>Effective ways to unload the brain</h2>
            <p>Regardless of the ultimate goals, brain relaxation is performed in compliance with certain recommendations. The first is the belief that it is possible to achieve relaxation without resorting to any sophisticated Eastern practices. Without observing this condition, the brain will be loaded even in a relaxing environment. The second recommendation is a systematic approach. It is necessary to adjust different aspects of life, and diligence is important in this. During a stressful situation, listen to yourself. Usually, before a breakdown, the body begins to give certain signals. If you learn to recognize them, you can pull yourself together in time and prevent tension. Count to 10. Grandma's way, but it works fine, the main thing is to want to relax. At this point, you need to monitor your breathing: inhale, delay for 3 seconds, exhale. This approach allows you to keep yourself calm, and it will not only be visible. Don't avoid introspection. As soon as the stressful situation is over, sit down and analyze your experiences. What exactly are they caused by? Can you influence something? It is good if you can imagine another person in a similar situation and ask these questions mentally to him. The information received will help to keep calm in the future. Control negative thoughts, don't let them get you carried away, translate their course into a positive direction. Many people experience stress only because they scroll through a negative situation in their head day and night.</p>

            <h2>General recommendations</h2>
            <p>It's stupid to try to be relaxed if you periodically spur the nervous system, and modern people most often do this. If you lead the right lifestyle, you will be able to stay calm more often and pull yourself together in time. So, if you feel that you periodically become a hostage of negative moments and are emotionally involved in them, follow the following rules: Limit the use of strong tea, especially green tea, and coffee. Caffeine stimulates the nervous system, deprives you of an adequate response to stimuli. Spend at least an hour a day outdoors. If possible, go out of town, if not, just stay in the yard or take a walk in the city park. Get involved in sports. It is not necessary to exhaust yourself, but a light jog in the morning or at night will strengthen the nervous system. Limit or stop eating sweets altogether: they give you excessive energy, and it is not a fact that it will be directed in a beneficial direction. Stop viewing news feeds on social networks. There is no benefit from them, and the brain is overloaded.</p>
